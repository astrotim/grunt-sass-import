# grunt-sass-import

> A Grunt module for importing Sass partials with some notion of source order

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-sass-import --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-sass-import');
```

## The "sass_import" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `sass_import` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass_import: {
    options: {},
    dist: {
      files: {
        'destination file': [source files]
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### Options

#### options.basePath
Type: `String`
Default value: `''` (empty string)

Defines the environment for the Sass files to live in. All the paths defined in `files` as well as the destination files will be relative to `basePath`.
A common example would be setting `basePath` to `'sass/'`.

#### options.includeExtension
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: `false`

Whether to include file extensions in the `@import` statements (e.g. `@import file.scss` rather than `@import file`)

### Including files
One of the main issues with Sass partial loaders is the source order is important. For example, if you declare a variable in partial `_a.scss` and make use of it in `_b.scss`, you have to import `_a.scss` and then `_b.scss`, otherwise you'll see an error.
This Grunt plugin offers a **very basic** support for manipulating source order.

#### Basic syntax
If you don't care about source order, you can simply pass an array of file paths to be included.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass_import: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      'main.scss': ['base/*', 'mixins/*', 'modules/*']
    },
  },
});
```

In this case, all the files from `base/*` will be included in their natural order (alphabetically), as well as all the files from `mixins/*` and finally `modules/*`.

#### Advanced syntax
If you have a partial that depends on others within the same directory, you can chose to include it after all the other files.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass_import: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      'main.scss': [{path: 'global/*', after: 'global/_global.scss'}]
    },
  },
});
```

Conversely, you can choose to import a file first, before all the other files in a directory.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass_import: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      'main.scss': [{path: 'global/*', first: 'global/_headings.scss'}]
    },
  },
});
```

### Typical use case
A typical use case is to have `sass_import` creating a main Sass file with all the imports which will then feed into a Sass task to generate the CSS code.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass_import: {
    options: {
      basePath: 'sass/'
    },
    files: {
      'main.scss': [{path: 'global/*', first: 'global/_headings.scss'}]
    },
  },

  sass: {
    dist: {
      options: {
        style: 'compressed'
      },
      files: {
        'web/css/main.css': 'main.scss'
      }
    }
  },

  watch: {
    stylesheets: {
      files: ['sass/**/*.scss'],
      tasks: ['sass_import', 'sass']
    }
  },
});
```
